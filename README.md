# MLOps Course Project

## Course Overview
This project is part of the **Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)** course. The course focuses on productionizing and monitoring machine learning models, bridging the gap between data science and engineering teams. Students learn to develop production-ready models, deploy them efficiently, manage their lifecycle, and build fully automated MLOps pipelines. By the end of the course, students deliver a fully functional MLOps project.

## Project Summary
This repository contains code and resources developed throughout the course, including:
- **Data processing and preparation scripts**
- **Machine learning model development**
- **Deployment scripts and configuration for production**
- **Monitoring and lifecycle management utilities**
- **Automated MLOps pipeline setup**

The code demonstrates best practices in developing scalable, robust, and maintainable machine learning systems.
